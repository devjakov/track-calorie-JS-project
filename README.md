# track-calorie-JS-project
This was my first 'serious' JS project as practice.

In this one I learned what it takes to organize different controller modules for storage, UI and all the event listeners.
I learned how to organize functions and how to write each component one by one.
I learned how to save important data I will use again and again into Arrays and functions that call those arrays. This really helped me not to repeat myself :D

Overall it was a really fun project, took me a couple days and now I see what it takes to write even the most 'simple' application :D
